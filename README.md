# Rust

- Rust is a low-level statically-typed multi-paradigm programming language thatâ€™s focused on safety and performance.
- It solves the problems that C/C++ has been struggling with for a long time, such as memory errors and building concurrent programs.
- It has three main benefits :
  1. Better memory safety due to the compiler.
  2. Easier concurrency due to the data ownership model that prevents data races.
  3. Zero-cost abstractions.
